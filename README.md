Spotify cache folder cleaner

I've made this script after noticing that my OS drive space utilization ramped up to 12gb~ in a day, and it didn't matter how much I purged it from useless data it would always use some more, but then, casually modding a game at the application data folder, I noticed that my spotify appdata folder was HUGE, so there I went googling what the flip is going on with spotify and it turns out that- nothing, it's just spotify's normal cache usage (even if you do NOT download your offline songs), so I've made this script which executes a very simple task: to obliterate spotify's dumb cache folder

use it, modify it, recreate it, do whatever you want with it, it's simple enough that anyone who has access to the file in context can learn how it works in ~5 min
